Contains 'a' box harmonic coefficients for Arridge and Eggington (2022) magnetopause field model of Uranus in nT*R_U, organized as a_ki, so that each row represents a single i and each column a single k. Unlike spherical harmonics, there are no powers of i or k, so the indices are arbitrary. See https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2021.114562
