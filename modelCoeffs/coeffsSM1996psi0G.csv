Contains 'G' Schmidt semi-normalized spherical harmonic coefficients for Schulz and McNab (1996) magnetopause current field model, organized as G_mn in dimensionless units, so that each row represents a single n and each column a single m. See https://doi.org/10.1029/95JA02987 . These coefficients are for the "psi = 0" model.
