% Parameters
% ----------
% inputName : type, dims
%     Description of variable. Delete dims for a scalar or replace with e.g. 1xN for a 1D row
%     vector, Nx1 for a 1D column vector, NxM for a matrix, etc. For struct inputs, specify which
%     fields are required and what they must contain.
% exampleNums : double, 1xP
%     Example row vector of doubles. Use a different letter for each dummy vector size unless the
%     size must match another input parameter.
% optionalInput : type, dims, default=DefVal
%     Explanation of optional argument.
%
% Returns
% -------
% outputName : type, dims
%     Description of output variable. This whole section can be omitted for scripts and functions that return nothing.

% Further information or user warnings. Refer to https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html#docstring-sections for valid headings:
%
% * Bullet point 1. For a very long line that extends onto the next, indent to the same
%   as the start of text after the asterisk.
% * Same for this other bullet. There must be blank lines between bullets and surrounding text.
%   Indentation REALLY matters with sphinx.
